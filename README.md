This page acts as an online repository of animations created using the pylj package.<br>
<br>
It is built using the Jekyll 'minimal' theme from github.<br>

## Adding a new page.

Add the animation into `/assets/vids`. Then use one of the other pages as a template to create a new page, and a link to the new pages to the `index.md` file.
